not sure why the elements appear larger than specified for the view port in the browser dev tools

When applying the hover and opacity affect with text over an image for the flex-images class items the affect isn't being carried out by the browser, I tried to set this up on the first image element in this group by putting it in a container and then another container to use the relative and absolute positions to specify their locations.  I emulate an example described by the W3 site.
